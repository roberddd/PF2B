<!-- !!! info2 "Updates"
    BatchGenie respects your privacy. It operates offline and does not collect any data. Therefore, there is no auto-update functionality within the add-on. For updates, simply download the updated add-on manually from the store where you purchased it, uninstall the old version and reinstall the new using the same steps outlined in the instructions above. -->


### Finding PF2B and Using the Documentation

PF2B is located in the N-Panel inside the `3D Viewport` under a tab named `PF2B`, as shown in the image below.

Every feature includes hover-over tooltips, providing quick and detailed explanations directly within the add-on interface, making it easy to understand functionality without needing to leave the workspace. Some areas also have an extra :octicons-question-24: icon, which opens a popup with additional information and a link to the relevant section of the documentation for further instructions.


For more comprehensive guidance, you can access the full documentation by clicking the :blender_icon_help:icon in the main panel.
