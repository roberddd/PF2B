    The Biomes & Collections features are not yet released. Coming soon...


Collections are groups of plants designed to **speed up the process of building your Blender Asset Library**.

If you prefer working directly from the **Asset Browser** (instead of importing plants on-demand), this feature lets you quickly batch-import entire categories of plants to populate your library in one go.

---

## How it Works

The Collections system is a **sister feature to Biomes**.
Both share the same PF2B window and rely on the same underlying library.

This means that any plants imported via Collections are stored inside the **same `.blend` files** that Biomes use.
So, whether you import through Biomes or Collections, the assets end up in a unified, consistent library.

## Notes

- âœ… The Collections importer is **smart**: it wonâ€™t import duplicate assets.
- ðŸ”Ž Before importing, PF2B checks your existing Asset Library to see which plants you already have.
- ðŸ“‹ You can use the menu options to **review the status of plants** in each category at any time.

## Summary

- Use **Biomes** when you want **ready-to-scatter ecosystems**.
- Use **Collections** when you want to **bulk-import plants** for direct use via Blenderâ€™s Asset Browser.
