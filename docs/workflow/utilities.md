There are some utilities that might be useful after the import for certain cases.

## Plant Renamer

Allows you to rename selected plant objects in the scene after import. The naming is based on the same settings used during import, but applied retroactively. You can easily select either all plants in the scene, or manually select the plants needed.


## Reset Asset Thumbnails

Restore missing or changed asset previews to their original images.

This function allows you to restore the original thumbnails (asset previews) for any plant assets imported through the PF2B addon. If a thumbnail was accidentally deleted, modified, or lost, you can use this tool to revert it back to the default preview without having to reimport the plant. This is especially useful for maintaining a clean and consistent look in the Blender Asset Browser, ensuring that all your assets display their correct preview images.
