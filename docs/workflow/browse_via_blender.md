    !!! info2 ""
        While an import is in progress, this message is shown:

        ![plant gallery top panel](../images/import-in-progress.webp){ .img-box }

        - :octicons-x-circle-fill-12: **Reset Import**: soft-resets the import if it gets stuck, re-enabling the *Import Plant* button. It does **not** stop any PlantFactory process running in the background, you must cancel that manually.

- :octicons-stack-24:: **Use import Queue**, see the [Queue](#queue) section for details.



### Import Overrides

These settings allow you to manually define the **Age/Maturity**, **Health**, and **Season** of imported plants. Each property has its own **checkbox** and **slider**. To activate an override for a specific property, tick the checkbox next to it and adjust the slider to your desired value.

![plant gallery top panel](../images/import-overrides.webp){ .img-box align=left }

When an override is enabled, it will replace the plant's default preset value for that property during import. If left unticked, the original preset value will be used instead.

- **Settings**:
    - **Maturity**: Controls the plant's maturity, representing its current age as a ratio of its maximum potential age. A value of 0 represents a young plant, while 100 indicates the plant has reached its maximum age.
    - **Health**: Controls the plant's health from 0 to 100. A value of 0 represents a dying plant, while 100 indicates a thriving, fully healthy plant.
    - **Season**: Select the day of the year (1-365) to determine the season based on northern hemisphere meteorological standards.

The override settings are stored in the [Plant Details](./post_processing.md#plant-details) section after import, in case you need to reference them later.

!!! abstract "Override Examples"
    Here is the **Ficus carica (Common Fig Tree)** plant exported with different override settings, all using the same seed for consistency. These are just examples, since you have fine-grained control over the override values, you can generate any variation in between.

    **Maturity:**
    ![Import Override example](../images/plants/overrides/Maturity.webp){ .on-glb data-description="Import Override: Maturity" }

    **Health:**
    ![Import Override example](../images/plants/overrides/Health.webp){ .on-glb data-description="Import Override: Health" }

    **Season:**
    ![Import Override example](../images/plants/overrides/Season.webp){ .on-glb data-description="Import Override: Season" }

!!! info2 "Note"
    When using these overrides, values such as plant height and polygon count shown in the preset descriptions may not be accurate, as the override settings affect how the plant is generated.

<div style="clear:both"></div>



### LODs

When enabled, you can choose which Levels of Detail to import.

![Queue](../images/lods.webp){ .img-box align=left }
LOD 0 is the default, highest-detail geometry, while higher LOD numbers use progressively simpler geometry for performance optimization. You can enable or disable any combination of LODs, allowing you to import only the versions you need.

!!! info2 "Notes"
    - The available LODs depend on how the plant was set up in PlantFactory. Most plants provide LODs 0-3, but some may have fewer or more. Selecting a higher LOD does not guarantee it exists; only the plant's defined LODs will be imported.
    - When the 'Extra LODs' feature is enabled, PlantFactory generates all available LODs internally, which requires additional processing time, regardless of which ones you select. PF2B will then only import the LODs you've chosen, but the processing time is the same no matter which or how many LODs you select.

<h5>Examples</h5>

Example of LODs with the `Adansonia digitata (Baobap Tree)` plant using the `Standard mat 25` preset, exported in all three available detail levels: HD (High Detail), LD (Low Detail), and RT (Realtime, which also uses billboards):

=== "Wireframe"
    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/wireframe/HD.webp){ .on-glb }

    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/wireframe/LD.webp){ .on-glb }

    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/wireframe/RT.webp){ .on-glb }

=== "Rendered"
    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/HD.webp){ .on-glb }

    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/LD.webp){ .on-glb }

    ![LOD example](../images/plants/lods/RT.webp){ .on-glb }

!!! info2 ""
    Note that polygon counts can vary greatly depending on the plant and preset. In this example, the `Standard mat 25` preset is used, where the "mat 25" indicates the plantâ€™s **maturity**, representing its age as a percentage of its maximum potential. A value of **0** means the plant is very young, while **100** represents full maturity. For this tree, maturity has a huge impact on both height and polygon count: at 0% maturity it is roughly 5.5 m tall, while at full maturity it reaches about 16 m. At 25% maturity, as shown here, the plant is around 11 m tall. There are many other presets available for this plant, some of which reach even greater sizes.


### Queue

The queue system lets you add multiple plants to a queue, which you can then import in a single batch, simplifying the process of importing various species and presets.


The queue can be activated by pressing the :octicons-stack-24: icon to the right of the `Import` button. Once activated, the `Import` button changes to `Add to Queue`, and two new options appear below: an `Import All` button and the :material-menu: `Queue Actions` menu.

You can now browse plants and use any of the `Add to Queue` buttons to add them to the queue.

---

![Queue](../images/queue_empty.webp){ .img-box align=right }

- :blender_icon_import: **Import All**: Import all plants in the queue.
- :material-menu: **Queue Actions**:
    - **Save Queue**: Save the current plant import queue to an external `.pf2bqueue` file for backup or reuse. The file is small and easy to store.
    - **Load Queue**: Load a plant import queue from an external `.pf2bqueue` file.
    - **Clear Queue**: Remove all plants from the queue.

---


![Queue](../images/queue.webp){ .img-box align=left }

Each queue item shows the following buttons:

- :octicons-info-16:: Opens a popup displaying information about the plant. Read more in the [Plant Info Popup](#plant-info-popup) section.
    ![plant gallery top panel](../images/plant-info-popup_preset-with-image.webp){ .img-box .on-glb align=right width=27% data-description="Plant Info Popup"}
- **Quantity**: The number field lets you specify how many of this plant will be imported.
- :fontawesome-regular-trash-can:: Delete the plant from the queue.

<div style="clear:both"></div>



### Gallery View

In this view, you can see all available plants and presets. To exit the gallery view, click the `X` in the top right corner or press `Escape` on your keyboard.

!!! info2 inline "Plants"
