This panel allows you to edit the visuals of your already imported plants. It provides a faster way to modify specific material settings compared to manually editing each material, as it targets all material slots with a specific type of material. For example, an imported plant may have five different leaf materials assigned to it, and editing via the `Post Processing` panel will update all of them simultaneously.


## Instructions

Select a plant in the `3D Viewport`, and you will be presented with the detected material types, as shown below. Clicking on a material type, such as "Leaf", will open a popup that allows you to edit the material properties for that type.
