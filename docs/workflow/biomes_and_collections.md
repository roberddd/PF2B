# Biomes & Collections

!!! warning ""
    The Biomes & Collections features are not yet released. Coming soon...

PF2B offers two powerful ways to work with groups of plants: **Biomes** and **Collections**.
Both systems help you quickly bring plants from PlantFactory into Blender, but they serve slightly different purposes.


## When to Use

| Feature      | Best For | What You Get |
|--------------|----------|---------------|
| **Biomes**   | Creating structured plant setups for scattering | Ready-to-use, curated ecosystems (meadows, forests, wetlands, etc.) that integrate with **Geo-Scatter** or **Biome-Reader**. |
| **Collections** | Building up your Blender Asset Library | Bulk import of plant categories so you can access them directly from Blenderâ€™s **Asset Browser**. |


## Key Difference

- **Biomes**: Pre-structured ecosystems ready for scattering with third-party plugins.
- **Collections**: Bulk asset imports for direct manual use in Blender.

Both systems share the same underlying `.blend` files, meaning plants you import via Collections are available to Biomes (and vice versa).
