<div class="changelog" markdown>

### 1.1.2 <small>2025-05-03</small>

- **New Functionality**
    - Added an `Import Name Settings` section that lets you customize how plant objects are named during import. You can now append details such as maturity, health, height, and more to the object name. [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#name-settings)
- **Improved Functionality**
    - The `Mark as Asset` option now also adds plant details (such as preset name, maturity, health, season, etc.) as asset tags for better organization and searchability. [More info](workflow/import_settings.md)
- **Other**
    - Plants imported via the bridge in `Browse via PlantFactory` mode no longer include the file extension (such as `.tpf` or `.tpfp`) in the imported name.

### 1.1.1 <small>2025-04-26</small>

- **New Functionality**
    - Added `Import Overrides` that allow you to manually define the Age/Maturity, Health and Season of imported plants. When enabled, the selected values will override the plant's default preset settings during import. [More info](workflow/browse_via_blender.md#import-overrides).
- **Interface**:
    - The `Plant Details` section and the information gathered from imported plants have been restructured for clarity. [More info](workflow/post_processing.md#plant-details). Examples include:
        - `Age` and `Age Max`, previously shown as arbitrary values, are now used to derive the plant's **maturity** value (used internally by PlantFactory), which ranges from 0 to 100%.
        - `Season` is no longer shown as a raw float (e.g., 1.0), but instead displayed as a **percentage** along with an **approximate day of the year** (1â€“365).
        - `Health` is now shown as a **percentage from 0 to 100**, instead of a float like 1.0.
        - If import overrides were used, the `Plant Details` section will now also display those override values for the selected plant.

### 1.0.7 <small>2025-03-26</small>

- **Bugfixes**
    - Fixed issues with plant libraries that were not installed in the default location, where their paths were not being used correctly, which prevented you from using the plants.

---

### 1.0.6 <small>2025-03-26</small>

- **Other**
    - The `Re-Index Plants` function no longer indexes the personal library by default; it is now only indexed when the personal library is enabled.
- **Plant-Fixes**:
    - **New**:
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Adansonia digitata HD`
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Adansonia digitata LD`
- **Bugfixes**
    - Fixed an issue where the `PlantFactory` library plants were incorrectly indexed by the re-index function (also affecting the 'verify' cache function), which prevented you from using the plants.

---

### 1.0.5 <small>2025-03-24</small>

- **Bugfixes**
    - The previous `Separate Plant Library Paths` change caused issues when plant libraries were installed in custom folders, preventing the cache and indexing from working properly. This issue has now been fixed.

---

### 1.0.4 <small>2025-03-22</small>

- **Improved Functionality**
    - **Improved Info Button:** The info button, available when browsing plants in the Gallery View or using the queue function, now shows if plant fixes are available and includes a button to display the specific fixes applied to the plant.
    - **Separate Plant Library Paths**: The Plant Library paths for PlantCatalog and PlantFactory are now separated, allowing you to store them in different locations while still using them within PF2B.
    - **Improved Cache Creation**: Creating Plant & Preset Cache now automatically triggers plant re-indexing and thumbnail reloading. Previously, only the "Verify" function triggered this. This should provide a smoother user experience by eliminating the need to manually perform these steps after caching custom plants.
- **Plant-Fixes**:
    - **New**:
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Bauhinia blakeana HD V2`
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Bauhinia blakeana LD V2`

        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Rhizophora seedling LD`
        - `PlantCatalog > Climbers > Hedera helix wall climber green HD`
        - `PlantCatalog > Climbers > Hedera helix wall climber green LD`

### 1.0.3 <small>2025-03-19</small>

- **New Functionality**
    - Added a `Check Version Status` button in the preferences to check for available updates. If a newer version is found, a download link to the latest version on BlenderMarket and Gumroad will be provided. [More info](preferences/general.md#version-check)
- **Interface**
    - Improved error reporting in the interface. Now also displays error messages if the operating system is not supported or if the wrong PlantFactory version is installed.

---

### 1.0.2 <small>2025-03-17</small>

- **Interface**:
    - Miscellaneous minor interface tweaks.
- **Bugfixes**:
    - The `Open` button in the "Post Processing > Plant Details" now works with plants without presets.
- **Other**
    - The Python library **psutil** bundled with the addon did not load properly on some systems due to Blender incorrectly interpreting the Python version number for this package. The version has now been renamed to reflect that it is intended for Python 3.11, as used in Blender.

---

### 1.0.1 <small>2025-03-16</small>

- **Interface**:
    - When browsing plants via the **Gallery view**, the **Presets** button is now disabled for plants that do not have available presets.

    - The `Plant Details` box in the `Post Processing` panel now displays the height and polygon count of the selected plant.
    - Miscellaneous minor interface tweaks.
