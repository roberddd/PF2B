### Versions

<div class="changelog" markdown>

### 1.1.7 <small>2025-10-XX</small>

!!! warning ""
    This version is not yet released and the changelog is not yet finalized. Coming soon!

- **New Functionality**
    - **Biomes & Collections**: [More info](workflow/biomes_and_collections.md)
        - Introduction to a brand new way to work with grouped plants: **Biomes** and **Collections**. Both systems help you quickly bring plants from PlantFactory into Blender, but each serves a slightly different purpose.
        - **Biomes** are ready-made, structured plant setups designed for natural environments like forests, meadows, and wetlands.
        - **Collections** are curated groups of plants designed for **bulk importing** into your Blender Asset Library. Unlike biomes, they are not structured scattering setups, but convenient bundles for building up your library quickly.
    - **Resume Functionality**: If an import fails after plants have already been exported from PlantFactory, you no longer need to re-export them. A new **Resume Import** button will appear, allowing you to continue the process directly with the already exported files.
	- **Import Naming Options**: [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#name-settings)
		- New **Advanced Mode** available for full customization of names.
		- **Skip LOD0 Label** option now available. When enabled, the base LOD0 version of the plant will not include 'LOD0' in its name. Higher LODs (LOD1, LOD2, etc.) are unaffected.
        - **Group Wrappers** added. This enables you to wrap the parameters inside one wrapper, such as: `Baobab Tree [Standard mat 0 | Seed 761869182 | HD]`.
		- Wrapper `|` added.
        - Wrapper `_` has been modified to ignore spaces.
        - Height option now has **Include unit** setting available.
		- Formatting options added for LOD.
        - These settings are also available in the new **Plant Renamer** utility.
    - **Utilities Panel**: New panel added with tools: [More info](workflow/utilities.md)
        - **LOD Importer**: Import selected plants with specific LODs while maintaining identical seeds to preserve their appearance.
        - **Plant Storer**: This utility lets you save selected plants from your scene into the structured biome `.blend` files. This allows you to access them directly from your Asset Library.
        - **Plant Renamer**: Renames selected plant objects in the scene after import. The naming follows the same settings used during import but is applied retroactively.
        - **Reset Asset Thumbnails**: This utility allows you to restore the original thumbnails (asset previews) for any plant assets imported through the PF2B addon.
    - New **Open in PF** button available in the **Plant Info Popup**. This allows you to open a specific plant directly in PlantFactory for inspection. Note that this does not use the PF2B Bridge and runs as a standalone session, meaning the plant cannot be imported back into Blender through this action.
    - When using the **Mark as Asset** feature now the Asset automatically retrieves an Asset Preview thumbnail, the same image from the Plant Browser will be used.
- **Improved Functionality**
    - The main interface panel is now faster and more responsive due to optimized background processes.
    - Materials for specific plant variations are now selectively renamed with variation-specific prefixes to ensure uniqueness and prevent unintended merging, even when base names are shared. This should result in fewer material merging issues during import for certain plants.
    - **Queue Save & Load**: Added `Add Selected Plants to Queue` option that adds all selected plants in the scene to the queue. [More info](workflow/browse_via_blender.md#queue)
    - **Verify Textures** tool under **Plant Troubleshoot Tools** has been improved: [More info](preferences/misc.md#troubleshooting)
        - Now also prints the Blender image name (not only the file on disk).
        - Displays the image file size.
    - When using the **Mark as Asset** in tandem with 'Import Overrides' the Asset description will be modified slightly from the default as well as a extra 'Import Overrides used' tag added to differentiate regular preset plants vs custom.
    - When using the **Mark as Asset** now the plant category will also be added to the metadata tags, such as "Broadleaf Trees".
- **Interface**
	- The **The Plant Gallery Browser** size is no longer related to the size of your **3D View** and should now always be the same size.
    - Main Interface layout has been improved with an additional dropdown list of the presets for the current plant. This lets you switch presets more quickly, alongside the two existing methods: using the arrow buttons or browsing via the Presets Gallery.
    - The **Plant Details** section in the **Post Processing** panel now has **copy to clipboard** button for the seed value of the plant. [More info](workflow/post_processing.md#plant-details)
    - The **Plant Info Popup**: [More info](workflow/browse_via_blender.md#plant-info-popup)
		- Now always shows the **Search for plant info** button regardless context.
        - Includes **copy to clipboard** buttons when **Debug To Console** is active, aiding troubleshooting.
		- Now also displays the preset number of the selected plant.
	- The `Preferences > General > Interface` section has been slightly organized and new options for the **Plant Gallery Browser** has been added: `Fill Rows First`, `Max Width` `Max Height` &  `Ignore resolution scaling` settings for the popup.
    - The **Browse Presets** button is now disabled in the main plant browser for plants without presets.
    - **PlantFactory Library** plants now display their **English name** in the interface when only a Latin name was previously available.
    - The **Plant Troubleshoot Tools** (that can be enabled via `Preferences -> Misc`) has been moved from the **Post Processing** panel to the new **Utilities** panel.
    - Confirm dialog has been added to the **Reset Import** function.
- **Other**
    - Internal changes to the `.pf2bqueue` files were made to support the new biomes system. Queue files from earlier releases may not be fully compatible with this version.
- **Bug Fixes**
    - **The Plant Gallery Browser** popup could spawn larger than the screen resolution, making it unusable on some setups.
    - **Create Missing Thumbnail Cache** for `PlantFactory Library` plants was creating thumbnails in the wrong location.
    - **Plant Info Popup** had issues displaying thumbnails for some PlantCatalog plants containing forward slashes in their names.
    - **Import Naming Options**: Wrapper `-` behaved incorrectly.
- **Plant-Fixes**:
	- **Updated**:

        *Materials now use the same tiling mode as in PlantFactory, fixing visible texture seams for the following plants:*

		- `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Eucalyptus camaldulensis HD`
		- `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Eucalyptus camaldulensis LD`
		- `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Eucalyptus viminalis HD`
		- `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Eucalyptus viminalis LD`

- **Improved Functionality**
    - **Import Settings > Name Settings**: [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#name-settings)
        - Completely revamped with a clearer interface and additional options. You can now choose different wrappers `() [] <>` around parameters for better customization of plant names.
        - Added an option to include the **Detail Level** in plant names.
    - **Plant Info Popup**: [More info](workflow/browse_via_blender.md#plant-info-popup)
        - Now displays plant maturity for presets.
        - The **Info** button in the main interface is now context-dependent: it shows plant information if a plant is selected, and preset information if a plant preset is selected.
        - Layout and design have been improved for consistency.
    - **Asset Tags & Metadata**: [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#general-settings)
        - The plant **Detail Level** (FG, HD, LD, RT) is now stored as an Asset Tag when using **Mark as Asset**.
        - Asset tags and descriptions stored when using **Mark as Asset** have been improved for better searchability in the Asset Browser.
            - The following values are no longer stored as tags (since they are rarely used for searching) but are now appended to the **Asset description** instead: *Maturity, Health, Height*.
            - This makes the information easily accessible when hovering over an asset in the browser, as it is displayed directly in the description after the preset description.
    - The plant **Detail Level** (FG, HD, LD, RT) is now stored with the plant object and accessible via the **Plant Details** panel after import. [More info](workflow/post_processing.md#plant-details)

- **New Functionality**
    - New option `Merge Duplicate Materials` to reduce material clutter when importing plants. When enabled, Blender will reuse existing materials with matching names instead of creating duplicates like Leaf.001, Bark.002, etc. This helps keep the scene cleaner and more optimized during batch imports. [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#general-settings)

---

### 1.1.2 <small>2025-05-03</small>

- **New Functionality**
    - Added an `Import Name Settings` section that lets you customize how plant objects are named during import. You can now append details such as maturity, health, height, and more to the object name. [More info](workflow/import_settings.md#name-settings)

### 1.1.1 <small>2025-04-26</small>

- **New Functionality**
    - Added `Import Overrides` that allow you to manually define the Age/Maturity, Health and Season of imported plants. When enabled, the selected values will override the plant's default preset settings during import. [More info](workflow/browse_via_blender.md#import-overrides).
- **Interface**:
    - The `Plant Details` section and the information gathered from imported plants have been restructured for clarity. [More info](workflow/post_processing.md#plant-details). Examples include:
        - `Age` and `Age Max`, previously shown as arbitrary values, are now used to derive the plant's **maturity** value (used internally by PlantFactory), which ranges from 0 to 100%.
        - `Season` is no longer shown as a raw float (e.g., 1.0), but instead displayed as a **percentage** along with an **approximate day of the year** (1–365).
        - `Health` is now shown as a **percentage from 0 to 100**, instead of a float like 1.0.
        - If import overrides were used, the `Plant Details` section will now also display those override values for the selected plant.

---

### 1.0.7 <small>2025-03-26</small>

- **Bug Fixes**
    - Fixed issues with plant libraries that were not installed in the default location, where their paths were not being used correctly, which prevented you from using the plants.

---

### 1.0.6 <small>2025-03-26</small>

- **Other**
    - The `Re-Index Plants` function no longer indexes the personal library by default; it is now only indexed when the personal library is enabled.
- **Plant-Fixes**:
    - **New**:
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Adansonia digitata HD`
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Adansonia digitata LD`
- **Bug Fixes**
    - Fixed an issue where the `PlantFactory` library plants were incorrectly indexed by the re-index function (also affecting the 'verify' cache function), which prevented you from using the plants.

---

### 1.0.5 <small>2025-03-24</small>

- **Bug Fixes**
    - The previous `Separate Plant Library Paths` change caused issues when plant libraries were installed in custom folders, preventing the cache and indexing from working properly. This issue has now been fixed.

---

### 1.0.4 <small>2025-03-22</small>

- **Improved Functionality**
    - **Improved Info Button:** The info button, available when browsing plants in the Gallery View or using the queue function, now shows if plant fixes are available and includes a button to display the specific fixes applied to the plant.
    - **Separate Plant Library Paths**: The Plant Library paths for PlantCatalog and PlantFactory are now separated, allowing you to store them in different locations while still using them within PF2B.
    - **Improved Cache Creation**: Creating Plant & Preset Cache now automatically triggers plant re-indexing and thumbnail reloading. Previously, only the "Verify" function triggered this. This should provide a smoother user experience by eliminating the need to manually perform these steps after caching custom plants.
- **Plant-Fixes**:
    - **New**:
        - `PlantCatalog > Broadleaf Trees > Bauhinia blakeana HD V2`
