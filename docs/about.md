Hello, I'm Roberd, a seasoned photographer based in Sweden with a passion for digital art. With over 20 years of experience in photography, my journey into the world of digital art began as I started experimenting with various graphic software tools along the way. In 2015, I discovered Blender and was captivated by its versatility and power. It quickly became my go-to tool for satisfying my creative needs, offering endless possibilities for creating complex 3D art and animations.
