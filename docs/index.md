**PF2B** (PlantFactory to Blender) is an addon that enables the direct import of plants created in [PlantFactory](https://www.bentley.com/software/e-on-software-free-downloads/){ target="_blank" } by e-on software into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/){ target="_blank" }. PF2B automates the setup process, allowing you to transfer detailed vegetation assets from PlantFactory to Blender with minimal manual configuration.

With PF2B, you gain access to over **200 plant species** and more than **10,000 unique presets**, with each plant procedurally generated using a customizable seed to guarantee a truly one-of-a-kind specimen every time. Available in both low-poly and high-poly variations to suit different performance and visual fidelity needs, PF2B offers a seamless workflow for bringing rich, realistic vegetation into Blender.
