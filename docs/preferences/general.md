    Note: PF2B does not download or install updates automatically and requires "**Allow Online Access**" to be enabled under `Edit > Preferences > System > Network`.

## Interface

- **Confirm on Import**:
    - When importing more than 1
    - When importing more than 10
    - Always
    - Never
- **Plant Thumbnail Size**: Adjust the size of the plant & preset thumbnails in the main Panel. This does not affect the thumbnail size in the Gallery view as it has its own setting directly available when browsing.
- **Use Preset Thumbnails**: Enable to display presets with thumbnails. Disable this option to show presets as a simple list.
- **Hide 'Browse via PlantFactory' mode**: If you only plan to use the [Browse via Blender](../workflow/browse_via_blender.md) mode, you can enable this to hide the mode selection at the top and declutter the interface.
