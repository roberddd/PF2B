## Interface

### Main Interface

- **Plant Thumbnail Size**: Adjust the size of the plant & preset thumbnails in the main Panel. This does not affect the thumbnail size in the Gallery view as it has its own setting directly available when browsing.
- **Use Preset Thumbnails**: Enable to display presets with thumbnails. Disable this option to show presets as a simple list.
- **Hide 'Browse via PlantFactory' mode**: If you only plan to use the [Browse via Blender](../workflow/browse_via_blender.md) mode, you can enable this to hide the mode selection at the top and declutter the interface.


### Plant Gallery Browser

- **Popup size**: Maximum width/height of the Plant Gallery browser as percentage of screen width.
- **Fill Rows First**: Fill row by row, instead of column by column.


### Biome & Collections Browser

- **Default Window Width**: Sets the initial width of the browser window. The window can still be resized manually after opening.


### Plant Details Utility

- **Display in Imperial Units**: Show dimensions in feet/inches instead of metric units. This affects [Utilities > Plant Details](../workflow/utilities.md#plant-details).


### Shader Editor

- **Add Right-Click Menu**: Adds PF2B to the right-click menu inside the Shader Editor, where you can access utilities such as adding node groups and shaders. [More info](../workflow/material_settings.md#shader-editor-right-click-menu)
