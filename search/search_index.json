Most notably: Biomes &amp; Collections, Snow, Wind and an overhauled Import Overrides section for more granular control of the plants.</p> <ul> <li>New Functionality<ul> <li>Biomes &amp; Collections: More info<ul> <li>Introduction to a brand new way to work with grouped plants: Biomes and Collections. Both systems help you quickly bring plants from PlantFactory into Blender, but each serves a slightly different purpose. This initial release introduces the core Biomes workflow with a small, curated set of biomes, laying the foundation for a system that will be expanded with additional biomes in future updates.</li> <li>Biomes are ready-made, structured plant setups designed for natural environments like forests, meadows, and wetlands.</li> <li>Collections are curated groups of plants designed for bulk importing into your Blender Asset Library. Unlike biomes, they are not structured scattering setups, but convenient bundles for building up your library quickly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Snow: Allows you to add winter effects such as snow accumulation and frost to existing assets. Multiple approaches are provides, including geometry-based and shader-based solutions, allowing you to balance visual fidelity and performance depending on the use case. More info</li> <li>Wind: Now you can import wind from PlantFactory. The animation is applied by generating an armature rig with bones that contain baked motion. More info More info</li> <li>Import Overrides overhaul: More info<ul> <li>New type Mesh Resolution, which lets you create \"Hero\" plants with higher mesh detail when increased.</li> <li>New Plant Specific overrides: a powerful way to harness a bit of the procedural power from PlantFactory directly inside Blender. These overrides correspond to individual nodes that exist within the plant's original PlantFactory graph, enabling fine-tuned customization.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Resume Functionality: If an import fails after plants have already been exported from PlantFactory, you no longer need to re-export them. A new Resume Import button will appear, allowing you to continue the process directly with the already exported files.</li> <li>Import Naming Options: More info<ul> <li>New Advanced Mode available for full customization of names.</li> <li>Skip LOD0 Label option now available. When enabled, the base LOD0 version of the plant will not include 'LOD0' in its name. Higher LODs (LOD1, LOD2, etc.) are unaffected.</li> <li>Group Wrappers added. This enables you to wrap the parameters inside one wrapper, such as: <code>Baobab Tree [Standard mat 0 | Seed 761869182 | HD]</code>.</li> <li>Wrapper <code>|</code> added.</li> <li>Wrapper <code>_</code> has been modified to ignore spaces.</li> <li>Height option now has Include unit setting available.</li> <li>Formatting options added for LOD.</li> <li>These settings are also available in the new Plant Renamer utility.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Utilities Panel: New panel added with tools: More info<ul> <li>Plant Details: Previously located in the Post Processing panel, this existing functionality has been moved to the Utilities panel for improved discoverability and workflow consistency.</li> <li>LOD Importer: Import selected plants with specific LODs while maintaining identical seeds to preserve their appearance.</li> <li>Plant Storer: This utility lets you save selected plants from your scene into the structured biome <code>.blend</code> files. This allows you to access them directly from your Asset Library.</li> <li>Plant Renamer: Renames selected plant objects in the scene after import. The naming follows the same settings used during import but is applied retroactively.</li> <li>Reset Asset Thumbnails: This utility allows you to restore the original thumbnails (asset previews) for any plant assets imported through the PF2B addon.</li> <li>Setup PlantFactory Shortcuts: Lets you set up your PlantFactory navigation shortcuts (Orbit, Pan, Zoom) to match Blender's controls for a consistent workflow.</li> </ul> </li> <li>New Open in PF button available in the Plant Info Popup. This allows you to open a specific plant directly in PlantFactory for inspection. More info</li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset feature now the Asset automatically retrieves an Asset Preview thumbnail, the same image from the Plant Browser will be used.</li> <li>The Edit Plant Materials buttons in the Post Processing panel now display the number of materials assigned to the plant when Shift + Click is used.</li> <li>Added a Shader Editor right-click menu for inserting PF2B node groups and shaders into existing materials. More info</li> <li>New Retry on Geometry Timeout option in <code>Preferences &gt; Misc &gt; Troubleshooting &gt; Import</code> to help resolve import issues with large batches.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Improved Functionality<ul> <li>Materials for specific plant variations are now selectively renamed with variation-specific prefixes to ensure uniqueness and prevent unintended merging, even when base names are shared. This should result in fewer material merging issues during import for certain plants.</li> <li>Imported plants now automatically receive viewport colors for both the object and all materials, based on the dominant color of the main texture. This improves visual clarity when using Solid viewport shading with color set to Material or Object. Only for Browse via Blender mode.</li> <li>For plants imported via Browse via PlantFactory, the plant name stored in Plant Details can now be edited.</li> <li>Queue: More info<ul> <li>Save &amp; Load: Added <code>Add Selected Plants to Queue</code> option that adds all selected plants in the scene to the queue.</li> <li>Group: Added a grouping function for organizing queued items.</li> <li>Show English Names: Added an option to display English plant names in the queue.</li> <li>Avoid Duplicates: Added an option to prevent duplicate entries from being added to the queue.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Verify Textures tool under Plant Troubleshoot Tools has been improved: More info<ul> <li>Now also prints the Blender image name (not only the file on disk).</li> <li>Displays the image file size.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset in tandem with 'Import Overrides' the Asset description will be modified slightly from the default as well as a extra 'Import Overrides used' tag added to differentiate regular preset plants vs custom.</li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset now the plant category will also be added to the metadata tags, such as \"Broadleaf Trees\".</li> <li>The Open Documentation button in the main interface is now multifunctional and opens the PlantFactory Reference Manual when holding Shift while clicking.</li> <li>Editing Materials via the Post Processing panel now supports Undo (Ctrl + Z)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Interface<ul> <li>The main interface panel is now more responsive due to optimized background processes.</li> <li>The The Plant Gallery Browser size is no longer related to the size of your 3D View and should now always be the same size.</li> <li>Main Interface layout has been improved with an additional dropdown list of the presets for the current plant. This lets you switch presets more quickly, alongside the two existing methods: using the arrow buttons or browsing via the Presets Gallery.</li> <li>The Plant Details section in the Post Processing panel now has copy to clipboard button for the seed value of the plant. More info</li> <li>The Plant Info Popup: design &amp; layout improved. More info<ul> <li>Now always shows the Search for plant info button regardless context.</li> <li>Includes copy to clipboard buttons when Debug To Console is active, aiding troubleshooting.</li> <li>Now also displays the preset number of the selected plant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The <code>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Interface</code> section has been slightly organized and new options for the Plant Gallery Browser has been added: <code>Fill Rows First</code>, <code>Max Width</code> <code>Max Height</code> &amp;  <code>Ignore resolution scaling</code> settings for the popup.</li> <li>Fill Rows First setting is now enabled by default, so the gallery is populated row by row instead of column by column.</li> <li>The Browse Presets button is now disabled in the main plant browser for plants without presets.</li> <li>PlantFactory Library plants now display their English name in the interface when only a Latin name was previously available.</li> <li>The Plant Troubleshoot Tools (that can be enabled via <code>Preferences -&gt; Misc</code>) has been moved from the Post Processing panel to the new Utilities panel.</li> <li>Confirm dialogs has have added to the Open documentation and Reset Import function.</li> <li>Open Changelog button now available in Preferences.</li> <li>Moved the Plant Details box from the Post Processing panel to the Utilities panel.</li> <li>The plant name in the Post Processing panel can now be clicked to display a popup with the Plant Details.</li> <li>Display in Imperial Units setting available in the Preferences for the Plant-Details function.</li> <li>All PF2B shaders are now imported with the node-group name dropdown hidden for a more compact layout. The name can still be accessed via the N-panel or by right-clicking the shader and selecting Show/Hide &gt; Node Options.</li> <li>Removed the Socket Port setting from Preferences, as it never needed and only added unnecessary clutter.</li> <li>Presets Gallery now displays the preset number before each preset name.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other<ul> <li>Internal changes to the <code>.pf2bqueue</code> files were made to support the new biomes system. Queue files from earlier releases may not be fully compatible with this version.</li> <li>Miscellaneous internal adjustments to import logic.</li> <li>Miscellaneous minor adjustments to Custom Shaders and Node Groups.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Bug Fixes<ul> <li>The Plant Gallery Browser popup could spawn larger than the screen resolution, making it unusable on some setups.</li> <li>Create Missing Thumbnail Cache for <code>PlantFactory Library</code> plants was creating thumbnails in the wrong location.</li> <li>Plant Info Popup had issues displaying thumbnails for some PlantCatalog plants containing forward slashes in their names.</li> <li>Import Naming Options: Wrapper <code>-</code> behaved incorrectly.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Plant-Fixes</p> <ul> <li> <p>New:</p> <ul> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Broadleaf Trees &gt; Koelreuteria bipinnata HD</code> - Fixed wrong color texture for a leaf material.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Updated:</p> <p>Materials now use the same tiling mode as in PlantFactory, fixing visible texture seams for the following plants:</p> <ul> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Broadleaf Trees &gt; Eucalyptus camaldulensis HD</code></li> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Broadleaf Trees &gt; Eucalyptus camaldulensis LD</code></li> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Broadleaf Trees &gt; Eucalyptus viminalis HD</code></li> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Broadleaf Trees &gt; Eucalyptus viminalis LD</code></li> </ul> <p>Fixed incorrectly assigned Color &amp; Alpha textures for leaf materials:</p> <ul> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Bushes &gt; Hedera helix 'Erecta' HD</code></li> <li><code>PlantCatalog &gt; Bushes &gt; Hedera helix 'Erecta' LD</code></li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["Release history"]},{"location":"changelog/#116-2025-08-26","title":"1.1.6 2025-08-26","text":"<ul> <li>New Functionality<ul> <li>Added a new Categorize into Collections option that automatically places imported plants into sub-collections (e.g. Broadleaf Trees, Bushes, Grass) for easier scene organization.

These files are expected to follow this naming convention:</p> <ul> <li><code>my_biome[HD].pf2bqueue</code></li> <li><code>my_biome[LD].pf2bqueue</code></li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>A queue file labeled as LD or HD does not need to contain only plants of that detail level. As a rule of thumb, the majority of plants should match the file\u2019s detail level, but mixing different detail levels across individual plants is encouraged.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you exported the queue manually and the file name does not include the detail level, rename it to indicate the detail level of the plants it contains. For example, if the file contains mostly LD plants: <code>my_biome.pf2bqueue</code> \u2192 <code>my_biome[LD].pf2bqueue</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To create the HD version, copy the LD queue file and rename it: <code>my_biome[HD].pf2bqueue</code>.</p> <p>Then, open the file in a text editor and update the <code>plant_name</code>, <code>plant_detail</code>, and <code>plant_path</code> values by replacing LD with HD as needed. You are encouraged to adjust and mix detail levels across plants to suit your biome, creating a custom balance of HD and LD plants. If you do not need mixed detail levels and prefer a strict HD or LD variant, it is recommended to use the automatic workflow instead.</p> <p>Example LD and HD queue files for reference; you can adjust detail levels as needed:</p> LDHD <pre><code>[\n    {\n        \"main_category\": \"PlantCatalog\",\n        \"plant_name\": \"Aesculus pavia LD\",\n        \"plant_type\": \"Broadleaf Trees\",\n        \"plant_detail\": \"LD\",\n        \"plant_path\": \"PlantCatalog\\\\Broadleaf Trees\\\\Aesculus pavia LD.tpf\",\n        \"preset_name\": \"Standard mat 25\",\n        \"preset_display_name\": \"Standard (25)\",\n        \"preset_number\": 1,\n        \"quantity\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"main_category\": \"PlantCatalog\",\n        \"plant_name\": \"Dryopteris filix-mas LD\",\n        \"plant_type\": \"Ferns\",\n        \"plant_detail\": \"LD\",\n        \"plant_path\": \"PlantCatalog\\\\Ferns\\\\Dryopteris filix-mas LD.tpf\",\n        \"preset_name\": \"Standard mat 0\",\n        \"preset_display_name\": \"Standard (0)\",\n        \"preset_number\": 0,\n        \"quantity\": 1\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> <pre><code>[\n    {\n        \"main_category\": \"PlantCatalog\",\n        \"plant_name\": \"Aesculus pavia HD\",\n        \"plant_type\": \"Broadleaf Trees\",\n        \"plant_detail\": \"HD\",\n        \"plant_path\": \"PlantCatalog\\\\Broadleaf Trees\\\\Aesculus pavia HD.tpf\",\n        \"preset_name\": \"Standard mat 25\",\n        \"preset_display_name\": \"Standard (25)\",\n        \"preset_number\": 1,\n        \"quantity\": 1\n    },\n    {\n        \"main_category\": \"PlantCatalog\",\n        \"plant_name\": \"Dryopteris filix-mas HD\",\n        \"plant_type\": \"Ferns\",\n        \"plant_detail\": \"HD\",\n        \"plant_path\": \"PlantCatalog\\\\Ferns\\\\Dryopteris filix-mas HD.tpf\",\n        \"preset_name\": \"Standard mat 0\",\n        \"preset_display_name\": \"Standard (0)\",\n        \"preset_number\": 0,\n        \"quantity\": 1\n    }\n]\n</code></pre> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Queue files ready</p> <p>So now you should have both <code>my_biome[LD].pf2bqueue</code> and <code>my_biome[HD].pf2bqueue</code> in the folder.</p> <p>Now continue with the Finishing Touches</p> </li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Render an image for the biome and place it inside the biome folder.</p> <ul> <li>File format: jpg</li> <li>Suggested image size: 500x500 pixels</li> <li>File name: same as your biome, e.g., <code>my_biome.jpg</code></li> </ul> <p>The image below shows the final biome folder structure, including the rendered image and queue files, as they should appear.</p> <p></p> </li> <li> <p>Testing the biome</p> <p>To test your biome in PF2B:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Create a new folder in the following path: <code>%USERPROFILE%\\AppData\\Roaming\\Blender Foundation\\Blender\\4.5\\extensions\\user_default\\pf2b\\biomes</code></p> <p>Tip</p> <p>You can quickly open this folder by going to <code>PF2B Preferences &gt; Plant Library &gt; Biomes</code> and enabling the <code>Biome Contributor Tools</code>, which will display additional buttons such as Open Internal PF2B Biome Folder.</p> </li> <li> <p>The root folder contains biome categories, such as <code>coniferous</code>.</p> <ul> <li>You can place your biome in an existing category or create a new one.</li> <li>The folder for your biome must be named exactly the same as your biome, e.g., <code>my_biome</code>.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>This will allow PF2B to recognize and load your custom biome properly.

In this example, the <code>Standard mat 25</code> preset is used, where the \"mat 25\" indicates the plant's maturity, representing its age as a percentage of its maximum potential. A value of 0 means the plant is very young, while 100 represents full maturity. For this tree, maturity has a huge impact on both height and polygon count: at 0% maturity it is roughly 5.5 m tall, while at full maturity it reaches about 16 m. At 25% maturity, as shown here, the plant is around 11 m tall.

The leaf color shift contains color correction data in the form of hue (R), lightness (G) and saturation (B) values from the leaf node in PlantFactory which create random color variations across all leaves. See the PlantFactory Reference Manual (page 890) for details.     To use the actual vertex data in the Shader Editor, access the PF2B menu via the right-click context menu and add the 'Color Shift' node group. This node group handles the color shift as described in the PlantFactory manual and is a recreation of the OSL script provided by PlantFactory.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Vertex Colors</p> <p>The plants in the PlantCatalog and PlantFactory libraries do not make practical use of most vertex color channels. Material Color, Material Blending, and Ambient Occlusion can be generated during import if enabled, but the library plants are not authored to use these channels in any meaningful way. Hierarchical Level and Leaf Color Shift are also not configured in the library plants and will only contain useful data if they are manually defined.</p> <p>As a result, if you are only using plants from the PlantCatalog or PlantFactory libraries, these settings can generally be left disabled. All vertex color channels can be created and imported, but they will only produce meaningful results when working with custom plants that are explicitly authored to use them.</p> <p>For practical examples and setup guidance, see the example usage section below.</p> <p>Tips</p> <ul> <li>You can reset the settings to default by clicking on  in the top right corner.</li> <li>Remember that you can always edit these settings for the plants after import by going to the Post Processing panel.</li> </ul> <p>Note on Roughness</p> <p>As you might have noticed, the roughness slider is not available here.

Surfaces facing upward receive thicker snow, while vertical and downward-facing surfaces receive less.</li> <li>Static: Applies a uniform snow thickness across all surfaces, regardless of orientation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Voxel Size: Controls the overall resolution of the snow shape. Smaller values create more detailed snow, while larger values produce a smoother, chunkier look. Very small values may introduce uneven or lumpy surfaces and often benefit from additional smoothing.</li> <li>Smoothing: Smooths the snow shape by softening sharp or uneven areas. Higher values apply more smoothing passes, helping clean up noise and artifacts, especially when using a small Voxel Size.</li> <li>Material: Selects the material assigned to the generated snow geometry.</li> <li>Seed: Controls the random variation used across the snow system.</li> <li>Preview Mode: Displays only the generated snow geometry and temporarily hides the original object mesh. This mode is intended for inspection and optimization. By isolating the snow mesh, it becomes much easier to evaluate mesh density, surface continuity, and the effect of optimization settings such as Smart Merge and Remove Loose Snow. Tip: Enable Wireframe view in the viewport to clearly inspect topology and vertex density while adjusting optimization parameters.</li> </ul> <p>Simulates snow falling from above using raycasting to detect exposed surfaces. Snow will mainly appear on surfaces that are exposed from the top, while sheltered or covered areas receive less or no snow. When disabled, snow is applied uniformly without surface detection.</p> <ul> <li>Enable: Enables or disables this panel and its controls.</li> <li>Snowfall Spread: Adds positional variation to the snowfall origin, breaking up uniform accumulation patterns and creating a more natural distribution.</li> <li>Use Wind: Adds directional wind that increases snow accumulation on one side of the object based on wind direction.<ul> <li>Wind Direction: Direction wind blows toward. Snow accumulates on the OPPOSITE side (e.g., North wind = accumulation on South side).<ul> <li>North</li> <li>North East</li> <li>East</li> <li>South East</li> <li>South</li> <li>South West</li> <li>West</li> <li>North West</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coverage Reduction: Reduces overall snow coverage by probabilistically discarding snow after it lands. Higher values result in sparser accumulation.</li> <li>Wind Turbulence: Adds variation to the wind influence, creating more irregular and less directional snow deposition.</li> <li>Snow Fall Angle: Controls how slanted the snowfall is when wind is enabled. Lower values produce gently drifting snow, while higher values cause snow to arrive at steeper angles and accumulate more on wind-facing surfaces. Internally, this modifies the raycast direction used for snow placement.<ul> <li>Very Low</li> <li>Low</li> <li>Medium</li> <li>High</li> <li>Very High</li> <li>Extreme</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Snow Buildup: Enables layered snow accumulation on upward-facing surfaces. When enabled, additional snow layers are built up on top-facing areas to simulate natural accumulation over time.<ul> <li>Buildup Layers: Controls how many accumulation layers are added to the snow. Higher values increase snow height and volume by stacking additional buildup layers.</li> <li>Buildup Layer Height: Controls the vertical height contribution of each buildup layer.</li> <li>Buildup Layer Shift: Adds horizontal variation between buildup layers to break uniform shapes. Positive values push layers outward, negative values pull them inward, helping avoid overly symmetrical or artificial snow profiles.</li> <li>Buildup Erosion: Controls how much the edges of the snow buildup are eroded. Higher values break up sharp edges and reduce buildup near boundaries for a more weathered appearance.</li> <li>Buildup Erosion Scale: Controls the scale of the noise used to erode the snow buildup. Lower values create broad erosion patterns, while higher values produce finer, more detailed breakup.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Visualize Snow Direction: Displays a viewport guide indicating the direction from which snow is falling, shown as a wireframe indicator with arrows above the object, and does not affect the final geometry or materials.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>Melt: Gradually reduces snow coverage based on exposure, simulating a general loss of snow.</li> <li>Melt Outer Threshold: Controls how quickly snow is reduced near exposed edges or outer regions. Higher values increase the affected area.</li> <li>Prefer Top Surfaces: Biases snow toward upward-facing surfaces. Higher values concentrate snow on tops of objects while reducing coverage on undersides and steep faces.</li> <li>Surface Offset: Moves the snow slightly away from the surface. Use this if the snow appears embedded inside leaves or geometry, helping it sit more naturally on top.</li> <li>Remove Loose Snow: Removes small, disconnected snow mesh islands. This setting cleans up isolated or floating pieces of snow that are not meaningfully connected to the main snow surface. Increasing the value removes progressively larger mesh islands.</li> </ul> <p>Adds breakup and irregularity to the snow surface.</p> <ul> <li>Enable: Enables or disables this panel and its controls.</li> <li>Surface Variation Strength: Controls the intensity of breakup and irregularity applied to the snow surface. Higher values exaggerate bumps, ridges, and unevenness, while lower values keep the snow smoother.</li> <li>Noise Scale: Scale of the base noise octave.</li> <li>Min Thickness: Attempts to preserve a minimum snow thickness.</li> <li>Expansion: Controls how much the noise displaces the snow surface.</li> </ul> <p>Explicitly removes snow using an object or height-based masking. This panel provides direct artistic control over where snow is cleared.</p> <ul> <li>Enable: Enables or disables this panel and its controls.</li> <li>Masking Mode: Defines which masking methods are used to remove snow.<ul> <li>Mask &amp; Z-Threshold: Combines object-based masking with height-based removal. Snow is cleared both where the mask object influences the surface and where the Z-threshold condition is met.</li> <li>Mask Only: Removes snow exclusively based on the mask object\u2019s position and influence. The Z height is ignored. Use this mode when you want precise, object-driven control.</li> <li>Z-Threshold Only: Removes snow based solely on height, independent of any mask object. Snow is cleared from the base upward according to the threshold value.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mask Object: Object used to control where snow is removed. The selected object defines a spatial influence that clears snow within its range. An Empty is recommended for easy positioning and adjustment.</li> <li>Threshold: Controls height-based snow removal along the Z axis. Snow is removed progressively from the base upward as this value increases. Lower values limit removal to lower areas, while higher values clear snow higher up the surface.</li> <li>Use Noise: Adds natural variation to the snow removal. This breaks up hard edges and creates a more organic, uneven transition.<ul> <li>Noise Scale: Scale of the base noise octave.</li> <li>Noise Roughness: Blend factor between an octave and its previous one. A value of zero corresponds to zero detail.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>These controls optimize the snow system for performance by reducing mesh complexity and viewport shading cost.</p> <ul> <li>Enable: Enables or disables this panel and its controls.</li> <li>Adaptivity: Reduces polygon density in flatter areas of the snow. Higher values create a lighter, simpler mesh, while lower values preserve more detail.</li> <li>Smart Cleanup: Enables an automatic optimization that reduces unnecessary geometry in areas where snow sits flush against underlying surfaces. The system targets regions that contribute minimally to the visible result, then processes these areas to reduce mesh density while preserving exposed and silhouette-critical details. This optimization significantly improves performance while maintaining visual quality in important areas.<ul> <li>Smart Cleanup Mode: Selects the method used to reduce geometry in targeted areas.<ul> <li>Merge: Combines nearby vertices within the cleanup threshold using a 'Merge by Distance' operation. This method maintains the snow as a continuous, unified mesh. Best for maintaining mesh continuity and when you need the snow to remain as a single, watertight object.</li> <li>Dissolve: Removes geometry entirely from the targeted cleanup areas, cutting away hidden portions of the snow mesh. This method can achieve more aggressive optimization but results in a mesh with open edges where geometry has been removed. Best for maximum performance when mesh continuity at the bottom is not required.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Smart Cleanup Threshold: Controls how much of the snow surface is considered eligible for Smart Cleanup optimization. This parameter adjusts the size and sensitivity of targeted areas using a combination of surface orientation (Z-axis normals) and curvature to identify regions that are flatter, less visible, or more tightly pressed against underlying geometry. Higher values expand the affected area, allowing more of the snow to be simplified. Lower values restrict processing to only the most suitable regions. This setting affects both Merge and Dissolve modes. Tune this setting in tandem with Cleanup Distance while visually inspecting the snow.</li> <li>Smart Cleanup Merge Distance: (Merge mode only) Controls how aggressively nearby vertices are merged during the Smart Merge process. This value defines the maximum distance within which vertices can be merged together. Larger values result in stronger simplification and fewer vertices, while smaller values preserve more detail. This setting should be adjusted together with 'Smart Cleanuo Threshold'. Use visual inspection of the snow surface to find a balance between performance and visual fidelity.</li> <li>Smart Cleanup Logic: Selects the method used to analyze surface curvature and determine which areas of the snow mesh are optimized. Both modes aim to optimize snow geometry intelligently; the difference lies in how precisely curvature is evaluated. The Simple mode prioritizes compatibility and performance, while the Advanced mode prioritizes accuracy and visual quality. This option is only available in Blender 5.0 or newer.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Global Merge: Performs a final vertex merge across the entire snow mesh to reduce overall geometry. This happens after all targeted optimizations like Smart Merge. It affects the entire mesh uniformly, simplifying geometry while potentially softening fine details. Use this to further reduce polygon count after other optimizations have run.<ul> <li>Global Merge Distance: Controls the distance threshold for the global merge. Vertices closer than this value are merged together. Higher values simplify the mesh more aggressively, reducing geometry density but potentially softening details or introducing minor artifacts.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Extra Viewport Optimization: Applies additional viewport-only optimizations to the snow system to improve performance without affecting renders.<ul> <li>Viewport Mode: Selects a viewport-only optimization preset that controls how snow materials and geometry are simplified for performance.<ul> <li>Material Only: Applies viewport-only optimizations to the default PF2B snow material by forcing Simple mode, disabling displacement and subsurface scattering, and reducing noise detail, without modifying geometry.</li> <li>Geometry Merge: Applies the default snow material optimizations and performs a medium-strength vertex merge to simplify the snow geometry in the viewport.</li> <li>Hidden (Snowflake Indicator): Hides the snow geometry in the viewport and displays a wireframe snowflake marker to indicate that the object has snow applied.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Settings available here might change / be updated in future versions as the geometry-node gets updated.</p>"},{"location":"workflow/post_processing/#geometry-node-snow-material-settings","title":"Material Settings","text":"<p>This panel shows the material currently assigned to the geometry node and allows you to edit it directly from this panel.
