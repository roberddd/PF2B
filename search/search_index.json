Coming soon!</p> <ul> <li>New Functionality<ul> <li>Biomes &amp; Collections: More info<ul> <li>Introduction to a brand new way to work with grouped plants: Biomes and Collections. Both systems help you quickly bring plants from PlantFactory into Blender, but each serves a slightly different purpose.</li> <li>Biomes are ready-made, structured plant setups designed for natural environments like forests, meadows, and wetlands.</li> <li>Collections are curated groups of plants designed for bulk importing into your Blender Asset Library. Unlike biomes, they are not structured scattering setups, but convenient bundles for building up your library quickly.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Resume Functionality: If an import fails after plants have already been exported from PlantFactory, you no longer need to re-export them. A new Resume Import button will appear, allowing you to continue the process directly with the already exported files.</li> <li>Import Naming Options: More info<ul> <li>New Advanced Mode available for full customization of names.</li> <li>Skip LOD0 Label option now available. When enabled, the base LOD0 version of the plant will not include 'LOD0' in its name. Higher LODs (LOD1, LOD2, etc.) are unaffected.</li> <li>Group Wrappers added. This enables you to wrap the parameters inside one wrapper, such as: <code>Baobab Tree [Standard mat 0 | Seed 761869182 | HD]</code>.</li> <li>Wrapper <code>|</code> added.</li> <li>Wrapper <code>_</code> has been modified to ignore spaces.</li> <li>Height option now has Include unit setting available.</li> <li>Formatting options added for LOD.</li> <li>These settings are also available in the new Plant Renamer utility.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Utilities Panel: New panel added with tools: More info<ul> <li>LOD Importer: Import selected plants with specific LODs while maintaining identical seeds to preserve their appearance.</li> <li>Plant Storer: This utility lets you save selected plants from your scene into the structured biome <code>.blend</code> files. This allows you to access them directly from your Asset Library.</li> <li>Plant Renamer: Renames selected plant objects in the scene after import. The naming follows the same settings used during import but is applied retroactively.</li> <li>Reset Asset Thumbnails: This utility allows you to restore the original thumbnails (asset previews) for any plant assets imported through the PF2B addon.</li> </ul> </li> <li>New Open in PF button available in the Plant Info Popup. This allows you to open a specific plant directly in PlantFactory for inspection. Note that this does not use the PF2B Bridge and runs as a standalone session, meaning the plant cannot be imported back into Blender through this action.</li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset feature now the Asset automatically retrieves an Asset Preview thumbnail, the same image from the Plant Browser will be used.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Improved Functionality<ul> <li>The main interface panel is now faster and more responsive due to optimized background processes.</li> <li>Materials for specific plant variations are now selectively renamed with variation-specific prefixes to ensure uniqueness and prevent unintended merging, even when base names are shared. This should result in fewer material merging issues during import for certain plants.</li> <li>Queue Save &amp; Load: Added <code>Add Selected Plants to Queue</code> option that adds all selected plants in the scene to the queue. More info</li> <li>Verify Textures tool under Plant Troubleshoot Tools has been improved: More info<ul> <li>Now also prints the Blender image name (not only the file on disk).</li> <li>Displays the image file size.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset in tandem with 'Import Overrides' the Asset description will be modified slightly from the default as well as a extra 'Import Overrides used' tag added to differentiate regular preset plants vs custom.</li> <li>When using the Mark as Asset now the plant category will also be added to the metadata tags, such as \"Broadleaf Trees\".</li> </ul> </li> <li>Interface<ul> <li>The The Plant Gallery Browser size is no longer related to the size of your 3D View and should now always be the same size.</li> <li>Main Interface layout has been improved with an additional dropdown list of the presets for the current plant. This lets you switch presets more quickly, alongside the two existing methods: using the arrow buttons or browsing via the Presets Gallery.</li> <li>The Plant Details section in the Post Processing panel now has copy to clipboard button for the seed value of the plant. More info</li> <li>The Plant Info Popup: More info<ul> <li>Now always shows the Search for plant info button regardless context.</li> <li>Includes copy to clipboard buttons when Debug To Console is active, aiding troubleshooting.</li> <li>Now also displays the preset number of the selected plant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The <code>Preferences &gt; General &gt; Interface</code> section has been slightly organized and new options for the Plant Gallery Browser has been added: <code>Fill Rows First</code>, <code>Max Width</code> <code>Max Height</code> &amp;  <code>Ignore resolution scaling</code> settings for the popup.</li> <li>The Browse Presets button is now disabled in the main plant browser for plants without presets.</li> <li>PlantFactory Library plants now display their English name in the interface when only a Latin name was previously available.</li> <li>The Plant Troubleshoot Tools (that can be enabled via <code>Preferences -&gt; Misc</code>) has been moved from the Post Processing panel to the new Utilities panel.</li> <li>Confirm dialog has been added to the Reset Import function.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other<ul> <li>Internal changes to the <code>.pf2bqueue</code> files were made to support the new biomes system.

For full functionality, it is also recommended to install the PlantCatalog library (approximately 20 GB), which significantly enhances the range of plants available for use but may take some time to download and install.</p> <p>PF2B does not guarantee 100% compatibility with all plants. With over 23,000 presets, it is not possible to manually test and verify each one. However, compatibility is very high, and approximately 99% of plants should import correctly without manual intervention.</p> <p>If you encounter issues, such as incorrect texture settings or geometry problems, please reach out. I will do my best to resolve them by adding plant-specific configurations to the addon.</p> <p>For more details, see the PF2B: Under the Hood page.</p>","tags":["Support"]},{"location":"getting_started/#installation","title":"Installation","text":"<p>Since the addon relies on the PlantFactory application for importing plants, it must be installed.

These files are expected to follow this naming convention:</p> <ul> <li><code>my_biome[HD].pf2bqueue</code></li> <li><code>my_biome[LD].pf2bqueue</code></li> </ul> <p>Tip</p> <p>A queue file labeled as LD or HD does not need to contain only plants of that detail level. As a rule of thumb, the majority of plants should match the file\u2019s detail level, but mixing different detail levels across individual plants is encouraged.</p> <ul> <li> <p>If you exported the queue manually and the file name does not include the detail level, rename it to indicate the detail level of the plants it contains. For example, if the file contains mostly LD plants: <code>my_biome.pf2bqueue</code> \u2192 <code>my_biome[LD].pf2bqueue</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>To create the HD version, copy the LD queue file and rename it: <code>my_biome[HD].pf2bqueue</code>.</p> <p>Then, open the file in a text editor and update the <code>plant_name</code>, <code>plant_detail</code>, and <code>plant_path</code> values by replacing LD with HD as needed.
