This addon relies on third-party software called PlantFactory (approximately 1.6 GB) to function. While PlantFactory is free, setting it up requires some additional steps, which are clearly outlined in 'Getting Started' guide. For full functionality, it is also recommended to install the PlantCatalog library (approximately 20 GB), which significantly enhances the range of plants available for use but may take some time to download and install.</p> <p>PF2B does not guarantee 100% compatibility with all plants. With over 23,000 presets, it is not possible to manually test and verify each one. However, compatibility is very high, and approximately 99% of plants should import correctly without manual intervention.</p> <p>If you encounter issues, such as incorrect texture settings or geometry problems, please reach out. I will do my best to resolve them by adding plant-specific configurations to the addon.</p> <p>For more details, see the PF2B: Under the Hood page.</p>"},{"location":"#documentation","title":"Documentation","text":"<p>Extensive documentation is available here.
