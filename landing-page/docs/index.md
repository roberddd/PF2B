**PF2B** (PlantFactory to Blender) is an addon that enables the direct import of plants created in [PlantFactory](https://www.bentley.com/software/e-on-software-free-downloads/){ target="_blank" } by e-on software into [Blender](https://www.blender.org/){ target="_blank" }. PF2B automates the setup process, allowing you to transfer detailed vegetation assets from PlantFactory to Blender with minimal manual configuration.
